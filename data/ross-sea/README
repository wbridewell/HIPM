The data in this directory were compiled by members of
Kevin Arrigo's laboratory at Stanford University.  Any
use of this data should cite the following paper as a 
reference on the Ross Sea ecosystem.

Arrigo, K. R., Worthen, D. L., & Robinson, D. H. (2003). 
A coupled ocean--ecosystem model of the Ross Sea: 2. Iron 
regulation of phytoplankton taxonomic variability and 
primary production. Journal of Geophysical Research, 
108, 3231.

The columns are:

  JD  -- Julian date.  The sample period crosses a new 
         year, but the value of JD continues to increase
         instead of starting over at 1.  Day 292 
         corresponds to October, 19th.
  ice -- The percentage of the Ross Sea covered by ice.
  PAR -- Photosynthetically active radiation at the sea
         surface.
  PUR -- Photosynthetically usable radiation at the sea
         surface in uE m-2 s-1.
  SST -- Sea surface temperature in degrees Celsius.
  NO3 -- The concentration of nitrates in umol/L.
  PO4 -- The concentration of phosphates in umol/L.
  P   -- The concentration of phytoplankton in ug C/L
         assuming all chla is Phaeocystis.  This is 
         equivalent to chla * 90.
  chla -- The concentration of chlorophyll a in 
          ug chla/L.

The source data come from heterogenous sources in both
time and space.  This data set has been processed to
represent the Ross Sea as a single point in space and
to interpolate missing values.

ross-sea-yr1.data contains trajectories for the summer
months crossing the 1996--1997 year boundary.

ross-sea-yr2.data contains trajectories for the summer
months crossing the 1997--1998 year boundary.
