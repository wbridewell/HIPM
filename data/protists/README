The data in this directory were taken from 

Jost, C., & Ellner, S. (2000). Testing for predator dependence in 
predator--prey dynamics: a non-parametric approach. Proceedings of 
the Royal Society of London B, 267, 1611--1620.

The columns are:
  t -- time in days, measurements were taken at 12 hour intervals
  aurelia -- number of individuals of P. aurelia (the prey) within 
             the population (averaged over 8 countings).
  nasutum -- number of individuals of D. nasutum (the predator) within
             the population (averaged over 8 countings).

Jost and Ellner extracted these data from earlier work by Veilleux.

The files 1a, 1b, and 1c correspond to the data plotted in Figures
1a, 1b, and 1c of the Jost and Ellner paper.  The other files are
shortened versions of the original trajectories created by removing
some of the initial data points.

Any papers reporting results from this data should cite the above
Jost and Ellner paper as the source.
